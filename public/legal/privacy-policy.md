## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how LocalPDF.online ("we", "our", "us", "Service"), operated by SIA "UL-COIN" (registered in Latvia), collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our website and services.

LocalPDF.online provides free PDF tools that work entirely in your browser. We are committed to protecting your privacy and have built our service with a "privacy-first" approach â€” your files never leave your device.

## 10. Data Retention

- **Analytics data**: Aggregated and anonymized, retained for up to 2 years
- **Technical logs**: Automatically deleted after 30 days
- **Local storage**: Persists until you clear browser data
- **No user files**: We never store your PDF files

## 11. International Data Transfers

As we don't process your files on our servers, there are no international transfers of your document data. Analytics data may be processed by services located outside the EU, but these services are GDPR-compliant.
