# Disabled CI/CD workflows
# 
# These workflows are currently disabled because:
# 1. Vercel provides automatic deployment from main branch
# 2. For a solo project, the overhead is not worth the complexity
# 3. The builds were failing due to strict quality checks
#
# You can re-enable them later when needed by:
# 1. Removing the .disabled extension
# 2. Fixing any TypeScript/ESLint issues
# 3. Configuring proper secrets if needed

# Original workflows moved to:
# - production-pipeline.yml.disabled
# - simple-ci.yml.disabled

This directory is kept for future CI/CD setup.
