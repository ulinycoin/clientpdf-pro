# DISABLED - CI workflows are currently turned off
# Vercel handles automatic deployment from main branch
# 
# These files are disabled to prevent build failures:
# - production-pipeline.yml -> production-pipeline.yml.disabled  
# - simple-ci.yml -> simple-ci.yml.disabled
#
# To re-enable:
# 1. Fix TypeScript/ESLint issues first
# 2. Rename .disabled files back to .yml
# 3. Test manually with workflow_dispatch trigger
