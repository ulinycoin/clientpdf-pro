### 2. Quality Control
- **Test merged output**: Open and review the merged PDF

- **Check formatting**: Confirm fonts and layouts remain intact

### 3. Metadata Management
- **Update document properties**: Set title, author, and subject
- **Preserve bookmarks**: Maintain navigation structure when possible

- Pages 3-8 from Document C

### Conditional Merging
Set up automated merging based on criteria:
- File naming patterns
