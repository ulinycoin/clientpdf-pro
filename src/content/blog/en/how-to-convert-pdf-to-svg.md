# How to Convert PDF to SVG: Guide for Designers and Developers

For web designers and developers, working with graphics requires flexibility and quality. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an image format that can be scaled to any size without losing sharpness. Converting PDF to SVG allows extracting logos, icons, and diagrams for use in web projects.

This guide will explain how to quickly and securely convert your PDF files to SVG format while preserving all the advantages of vector graphics.

## Why is SVG important?

- **Scalability**: SVG images look perfect on any screen, from mobile devices to large monitors.
- **Small file size**: For simple illustrations and icons, SVG often weighs less than raster formats (JPG, PNG).
- **Interactivity and styling**: SVG can be animated and styled with CSS and JavaScript.
- **Accessibility**: Text in SVG remains text, making it accessible to search engines and screen readers.
