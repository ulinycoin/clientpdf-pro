# How to Extract Pages from PDF to Create a New Document

Have you ever needed to create a new, shorter PDF from several pages of a large report or book? Page extraction is a key function for those who want to selectively share information without sending the entire source file. This differs from simple file splitting as it allows you to select specific, even non-consecutive pages.

This guide will show how to easily select and extract the needed pages from any PDF, creating a new, compact document using a secure online tool.

## When is page extraction useful?

- **Creating excerpts**: Compiling only relevant sections from large research for colleagues.
- **Email sending**: Creating a small file with several pages that's easy to send via email.
- **Meeting preparation**: Combining an agenda slide, several data pages, and a concluding slide into one file for handouts.
- **Privacy**: Providing access only to certain contract pages while hiding the rest of the document.
