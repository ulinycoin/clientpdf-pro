# 📝 Project Reset Session - June 30, 2025

## 🔄 FULL PROJECT RESET COMPLETED

### ✅ **Action Taken:**
Project was completely reset due to styling issues and complexity. Decided to start fresh with clean, minimal setup.

### 🗑️ **What was removed conceptually:**
- Complex inline styles approach
- Over-engineered component structure  
- Framer Motion dependencies (not working properly)
- React Dropzone complications
- Lucide React icon dependencies
- Custom CSS classes that weren't applying

### ✅ **What was preserved:**
- `.claude/` folder with all instructions and memory
- Basic project structure
- Essential dependencies (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind)

### 🎯 **Current Clean State:**
- **package.json**: Minimal with only essential deps
- **src/App.tsx**: Simple component
- **src/main.tsx**: Basic entry point  
- **src/index.css**: Tailwind CSS ready
- **src/pages/HomePage.tsx**: Minimal welcome page

### 📋 **Next Steps:**
1. Delete unnecessary old files via terminal
2. Set up proper Tailwind configuration
3. Create clean Atomic Design structure
4. Build components step by step following instructions
5. Test each component before moving to next

### 🎨 **New Approach:**
- Start with basic Tailwind classes
- Build incrementally
- Test each step
- Follow Atomic Design properly
- Keep dependencies minimal until proven needed

## 💡 **Lessons Learned:**
- Don't add too many dependencies at once
- Test Tailwind setup first before building components
- Inline styles should be last resort, not first choice
- Build incrementally, test frequently
