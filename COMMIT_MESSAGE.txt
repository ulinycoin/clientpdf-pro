fix: implement robots.txt as Vercel API route for reliable access

- Create /api/robots.txt.js serverless function to serve robots.txt content
- Add rewrite rule in vercel.json to route /robots.txt to API function
- This bypasses SPA routing and static file serving issues completely
- Ensures robots.txt is always accessible with proper headers
- Fixes 404 error on https://localpdf.online/robots.txt
