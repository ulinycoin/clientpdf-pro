Merging multiple PDF files is a common task, but arranging them in the right order can be tedious - especially when dealing with dozens of documents. That's why we built **Smart Merge**, an AI-powered feature that automatically analyzes your PDFs and suggests the optimal sorting order.

## What is Smart Merge?

Smart Merge is an intelligent assistant built into [LocalPDF's merge tool](/merge-pdf). When you upload multiple PDF files, it automatically:

- **Extracts dates** from document content and filenames
- **Detects patterns** in filenames (like "part1", "chapter2", "report_03")
- **Identifies duplicates** by comparing content and file sizes
- **Suggests sorting options** with confidence scores

Best of all? Everything runs **100% locally in your browser**. Your documents never leave your device.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Date Detection

Smart Merge scans your PDFs and extracts dates from:

- **Document content** - Dates mentioned in the text (invoices, contracts, reports)
- **Filenames** - Patterns like `2024-01-15_report.pdf` or `report_15.01.2024.pdf`
- **PDF metadata** - Creation and modification dates

It supports multiple date formats and languages including English, German, French, Spanish, and Russian.

### 2. One-Click Sorting

Once analysis is complete, you'll see sorting suggestions:

| Option | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Chronological** | Oldest documents first | Historical archives, project timelines |
| **Newest First** | Most recent documents first | Monthly reports, correspondence |
| **By Filename** | Sorted by numbers in filenames | Numbered chapters, sequential parts |
| **By Size** | Largest files first | Prioritizing main documents |

Each suggestion shows a **confidence score** based on how many documents have the required data.

### 3. Duplicate Detection

Uploading the same document twice? Smart Merge will warn you:

- Compares text content using smart hashing
- Considers file sizes and page counts
- Shows which files are similar
- One click to keep only the first copy

This is especially useful when merging documents from different folders where duplicates might exist.

## How to Use Smart Merge

1. **Open the [Merge PDF tool](/merge-pdf)**
2. **Upload 2 or more PDF files** - drag & drop or click to select
3. **Wait for analysis** - Smart Merge automatically scans your documents (usually under 1 second)
4. **Review suggestions** - Click any sorting option to instantly reorder your files
5. **Check for duplicates** - Remove similar files if detected
6. **Merge** - Click the merge button to combine your sorted PDFs

You can also **disable Smart Merge** using the toggle switch if you prefer manual ordering.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Combining Monthly Reports

You have 12 monthly reports named inconsistently (`Jan_Report.pdf`, `February-2024.pdf`, `march.pdf`). Smart Merge detects dates from the content and offers chronological sorting - no manual reordering needed.

### Archiving Project Documents

Merging various project documents accumulated over time? Smart Merge identifies duplicates (the same contract saved twice) and suggests date-based ordering.

### Compiling Legal Documents

Combining contracts, amendments, and exhibits? Smart Merge detects the dates within each document and ensures they're ordered correctly for legal compliance.

### Organizing Scanned Documents

Even scanned PDFs with OCR text can be analyzed. Smart Merge extracts dates from the recognized text to suggest proper ordering.

## Privacy First

Unlike cloud-based AI tools, Smart Merge runs entirely in your browser:

- **No uploads** - Your PDFs never leave your device
- **No API calls** - Analysis uses local JavaScript, not external services
- **No data collection** - We don't see or store your documents
- **Works offline** - Once the page loads, Smart Merge works without internet

This makes it safe for sensitive documents like financial records, legal contracts, and personal information.

## Technical Details

For those curious about how it works:

- **Text extraction** uses PDF.js (the same library Firefox uses)
- **Date parsing** supports 10+ regex patterns for different formats
- **Duplicate detection** uses SHA-256 hashing of text samples
- **Analysis time** is typically 50-200ms per document

The feature adds minimal overhead to the merge tool - only ~8KB gzipped.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use descriptive filenames** - Files named with dates (`2024-01-15_invoice.pdf`) get higher confidence scores
2. **Ensure text is selectable** - For scanned PDFs, run OCR first using our [OCR tool](/ocr-pdf)
3. **Check confidence scores** - Higher percentages mean more reliable sorting
4. **Review before merging** - Smart Merge is a suggestion tool, not a replacement for human judgment

## Conclusion

Smart Merge transforms PDF merging from a manual chore into an intelligent, automated process. Whether you're organizing a few documents or hundreds, the AI-powered sorting and duplicate detection save time while maintaining complete privacy.
