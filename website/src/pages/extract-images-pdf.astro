const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Can I extract images from password-protected PDFs?",
    answer: "No, you need to unlock the PDF first using our <a href='/unlock-pdf'>Unlock PDF tool</a> before extracting images. Password protection prevents access to the PDF's internal structure."
  },
  {
    question: "What image formats are supported?",
    answer: "Our tool extracts images in their original format from the PDF - typically <strong>JPEG</strong> or <strong>PNG</strong>. Images are saved without re-compression, preserving 100% of the original quality."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Remove Images mode work?",
    answer: "Remove mode lets you delete selected images from the PDF while keeping all text and other content. After selecting images, you'll download a new PDF with those images removed - perfect for reducing file size."
  },
  {
    question: "Why can't I see some images from my PDF?",
    answer: "Some PDFs use vector graphics (drawings created with code) rather than embedded images. Our tool only extracts <strong>raster images</strong> (JPEG, PNG) that are embedded in the PDF file. Vector graphics and background images may not appear."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit on PDF file size or image count?",
    answer: "No limits during beta! You can extract images from PDFs of any size with any number of images. Processing happens entirely in your browser, so your device's available memory is the only constraint."
  },
  {
    question: "Do extracted images lose quality?",
    answer: "No quality loss! Images are extracted in their original resolution and format without any re-compression or conversion. A 300 DPI image in the PDF will be extracted as a 300 DPI image file."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I extract images from scanned PDFs?",
    answer: "Yes, if the scanned document was saved with the actual image embedded. However, if it's a pure scan (image-based PDF), you might want to use our <a href='/pdf-to-images'>PDF to Images tool</a> to convert pages to image files instead."
  },
  {
    question: "Are my files uploaded to a server?",
    answer: "<strong>Never!</strong> All image extraction and removal happens 100% locally in your browser using JavaScript. Your PDF never leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy and security."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Smart Image Filter work?",
    answer: "Our AI-powered filter analyzes each image's dimensions, resolution, aspect ratio, and file size to automatically categorize it as a Photo, Chart, Logo, Icon, or Decoration. For example, PDFs often contain hundreds of tiny icons (16×16px) that you don't need — Smart Filter lets you click 'Photos Only' to instantly select just the 5 actual photos and ignore the 150+ junk images."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the Quick Filters?",
    answer: "Quick Filters are one-click presets: <strong>Photos Only</strong> selects high-quality photos, <strong>Useful Images</strong> selects photos and charts (excluding icons/decorations), <strong>Large Images</strong> filters by size, <strong>Charts & Graphs</strong> selects diagrams, and <strong>No Icons</strong> excludes tiny UI elements. These save you from manually deselecting hundreds of unwanted images."
