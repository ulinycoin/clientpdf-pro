  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    At LocalPDF, your privacy is not just a feature—it's our core architecture. Unlike traditional online
    PDF services that upload your files to remote servers, LocalPDF processes everything locally in your
    browser. This means we literally cannot access, view, store, or share your documents.
  </p>

  <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We don't collect your data because we never see it.</p>

  <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>None.</strong></p>

  <p>
    LocalPDF does not collect, process, store, or transmit any of the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>PDF files or documents you upload</li>
    <li>Personal information (names, emails, addresses)</li>
    <li>IP addresses or device identifiers</li>
    <li>Browser fingerprints or usage analytics</li>
    <li>Cookies (we don't use any cookies)</li>
    <li>Session data or browsing history</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box">
    <strong>Technical Explanation:</strong> When you upload a PDF to LocalPDF, the file is loaded directly
    into your browser's JavaScript runtime memory. All processing (merging, splitting, compressing, etc.)
    happens using client-side libraries (pdf-lib, PDF.js, Tesseract.js). There are zero network requests
    to our servers during processing. When you download the result, it's generated in your browser and
    saved to your device via the browser's native download API.
  </div>

  <h2>How LocalPDF Works (Privacy Perspective)</h2>

  <h3>1. File Upload</h3>
  <p>
    When you select a PDF file using our file picker, the browser reads the file from your local disk
    into memory. This happens entirely within your browser—no network transmission occurs.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Processing</h3>
  <p>
    All PDF manipulation happens in your browser using JavaScript and WebAssembly. The pdf-lib library
    (for merging, splitting, etc.) and PDF.js (for rendering) run locally. Your files never leave your
    device's RAM.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Download</h3>
  <p>
    When processing is complete, the modified PDF is generated in your browser's memory and offered as
    a download using the browser's built-in download mechanism. We don't intercept or store this file.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Cleanup</h3>
  <p>
    Once you close the browser tab or navigate away, all file data is automatically cleared from memory.
    There's no server-side storage, no backups, no "trash" folder.
  </p>

  <h2>GDPR Compliance (EU Regulation 2016/679)</h2>

  <p>
    LocalPDF is fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by design. Here's how
    we address each key GDPR principle:
  </p>

  <h3>1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency (Article 5.1.a)</h3>
  <p>
    Since we don't process personal data, we don't require a legal basis (consent, contract, legitimate
    interest, etc.) for data processing. Our service is transparent: what you see is what you get—100%
    client-side processing.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Purpose Limitation (Article 5.1.b)</h3>
  <p>
    Not applicable—we don't collect data, so there's no purpose to limit.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Data Minimization (Article 5.1.c)</h3>
  <p>
    We've minimized data collection to zero. You can't get more minimal than that.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Accuracy (Article 5.1.d)</h3>
  <p>
    Not applicable—we don't store data, so there's no data to keep accurate.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Storage Limitation (Article 5.1.e)</h3>
  <p>
    Data is stored only in your browser's temporary memory during active use. When you close the tab,
    it's erased. Storage duration: seconds to minutes, never longer.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Integrity and Confidentiality (Article 5.1.f)</h3>
  <p>
    Your data never leaves your device, so there's no risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, or
    interception. This is the highest level of confidentiality possible.
  </p>

  <h2>Your GDPR Rights</h2>

  <p>Under GDPR, you have the following rights. Here's how LocalPDF respects them:</p>

  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Right to Access (Article 15)</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to know what data we hold about you. Answer: None. We can't provide access
        to data we don't have.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Right to Rectification (Article 16)</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to correct inaccurate data. Not applicable—we don't store data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Right to Erasure / "Right to Be Forgotten" (Article 17)</h3>
      <p>
        Automatic. Your data is erased from browser memory when you close the tab. No manual request needed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Right to Data Portability (Article 20)</h3>
      <p>
        Not applicable—we don't store your data, so there's nothing to port.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Right to Object (Article 21)</h3>
      <p>
        Not applicable—there's no data processing to object to.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Right to Restrict Processing (Article 18)</h3>
      <p>
        Not applicable—processing happens locally in your browser under your full control.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

  <h3>Hosting</h3>
  <p>
    LocalPDF is hosted on standard web hosting infrastructure. When you load our website, your browser
    makes a standard HTTP request to retrieve static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). This is a normal
    web request and may be logged by our hosting provider (e.g., IP address, timestamp, user agent).
    However, these logs do not contain any PDF files or document content.
  </p>

  <h3>Fonts</h3>
  <p>
    We load the Inter font from Google Fonts. When your browser loads our site, it may request font
    files from Google's CDN. This is a standard resource request and does not involve transmitting
    your PDF files. You can read Google Fonts' privacy policy
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#what_does_using_the_google_fonts_api_mean_for_the_privacy_of_my_users" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Analytics</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any third-party tracking scripts.</strong>
    There are no cookies, no fingerprinting, no session recording.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Breaches</h2>
  <p>
    Since we don't collect, store, or transmit your personal data, there's nothing for us to breach.
    If a malicious actor gained access to our servers, they would find zero user data—no PDFs, no
    personal information, nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only theoretical risk is browser-level vulnerabilities (e.g., malicious browser extensions
    reading your local memory). This is outside our control and applies to all web applications.
  </p>

  <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Not applicable. Your data never leaves your device, so there are no cross-border transfers.
    You could be in Europe, Asia, or Antarctica—your PDFs stay local.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    LocalPDF does not collect personal data from anyone, including children under 13 (COPPA) or 16 (GDPR).
    Since we don't collect data, we don't need parental consent.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    If we ever change our privacy practices (unlikely, given our zero-data architecture), we'll update
    this page and change the "Last Updated" date above. Significant changes will be announced on our
    homepage.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact &amp; Data Protection Officer</h2>
  <p>
    For privacy-related questions, contact us at:
    <br><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@localpdf.online">privacy@localpdf.online</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Since we don't process personal data, we're not required to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)
    under GDPR Article 37. However, if you have concerns about GDPR compliance, feel free to reach out.
  </p>

  <h2>Supervisory Authority</h2>
  <p>
    If you're in the EU and believe we're violating GDPR (though we're not sure how, given we don't
    collect data), you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
    Find your authority <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <strong>Summary:</strong> LocalPDF is a privacy-first tool. We don't collect, process, store, or
    share your data. Your files are processed locally in your browser and erased when you close the tab.
    This is the safest way to work with PDFs online.
