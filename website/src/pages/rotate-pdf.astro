    title: "Why Choose Our PDF Rotate Tool?",
    reasons: [
      "True Privacy: Your PDF never leaves your computer. Cloud rotation tools upload files to servers. LocalPDF rotates pages locally using client-side PDF manipulation.",
      "Selective Rotation: Rotate specific pages, ranges, or the entire document. Perfect for fixing scanned documents with mixed orientations.",
      "Lossless Operation: Rotation is a metadata change, not a visual re-render. Pages maintain original quality, fonts, and vector graphics.",
      "Instant Processing: No upload time, no queues. Rotation happens in your browser at native speed â€” typically under 1 second.",
      "Preview Before Saving: See exactly how pages will look after rotation. Avoid downloading and re-uploading to check results.",
      "No File Size Limits: Rotate PDFs of any size. Cloud tools often cap uploads at 50-100 MB. Your browser's memory is the only constraint."
