  </p>

  <h2>3. Beta Status &amp; Free Access</h2>
  <p>
    LocalPDF is currently in <strong>beta testing</strong>. During this period, the service is free to use
    with no limits, no registration, and no watermarks.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> We reserve the right to introduce paid features, subscription plans, or
    usage limits in the future. However, we commit to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Providing reasonable notice (minimum 30 days) before any pricing changes</li>
    <li>Maintaining a free tier with core functionality</li>
    <li>Grandfathering beta users with special pricing (if applicable)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. No Warranties / "As-Is" Service</h2>
  <p>

    of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accuracy or reliability of PDF processing</li>
    <li>Uninterrupted or error-free operation</li>
    <li>Suitability for any particular purpose</li>
    <li>Non-infringement of third-party rights</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We strive to provide high-quality tools, but software has bugs. Use at your own risk.
  </p>
