      "Visual Selection Tool: Click and drag to select text areas directly on the PDF preview. Resize and move selections with precision. Real-time preview shows exactly how changes will look before applying.",
      "Professional Typography: Full control over font family, size, style (bold/italic), color, and positioning. Auto-detect original font size for seamless replacements. Fine-tune text placement with pixel-perfect X/Y offsets.",
