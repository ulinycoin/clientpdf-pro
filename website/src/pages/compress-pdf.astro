    title: "Why Choose Our PDF Compressor?",
    reasons: [
      "True Privacy: Your PDF never leaves your computer. Cloud-based compressors upload your files to servers where they may be stored or scanned. LocalPDF keeps everything local.",
      "Smart Compression: Removes redundant data, optimizes structure, and strips metadata without degrading content quality. Typical size reduction: 30-70%.",
      "No Size Limits: Compress PDFs of any size. Online tools often cap uploads at 50-100 MB. Your browser's available memory is the only constraint here.",
      "No Quality Degradation: Unlike aggressive server-side compression that ruins image quality, LocalPDF preserves readability and visual fidelity.",
      "Instant Processing: No upload delays. Compression happens at native speed in your browser — usually under 3 seconds even for large files.",
      "No Watermarks: Some free compressors add watermarks to output files. LocalPDF never modifies your content beyond compression."
