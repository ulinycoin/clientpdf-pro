const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much smaller will my PDF become?",
    answer: "Typical reduction is <strong>30-70%</strong> depending on the original file. PDFs with metadata, encryption, or redundant data compress more. Scanned documents with optimized images may see minimal reduction."
  },
  {
    question: "Will compression affect PDF quality or readability?",
    answer: "No! Our compression removes redundant data and metadata without touching page content. Text remains sharp, images keep their resolution. We do <strong>not</strong> downsample images or reduce quality like aggressive server-side compressors."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I compress password-protected PDFs?",
    answer: "Our compression automatically removes encryption and passwords as part of the optimization process. If you need to re-protect the compressed PDF, use our <a href='/protect-pdf'>Protect PDF tool</a> afterward."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does my PDF barely get smaller?",
    answer: "If your PDF is already optimized (e.g., created by modern software or previously compressed), there's less redundant data to remove. Scanned documents or PDFs with minimal metadata won't compress much."
  },
  {
    question: "What data gets removed during compression?",
    answer: "We remove: <ul><li>Encryption and password protection</li><li>Document metadata (author, creation date, keywords)</li><li>Hidden embedded data</li><li>Redundant structural elements</li></ul> We <strong>never</strong> remove or modify page content, images, or text."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I compress multiple PDFs at once?",
    answer: "Yes! You can batch-compress multiple files. Upload all PDFs at once, and each will be compressed individually. You'll download them one by one or as a ZIP archive."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a file size limit for compression?",
    answer: "No limits during beta! You can compress PDFs of any size. Processing happens in your browser, so your device's available memory is the only constraint. Most devices handle 100+ MB PDFs easily."
  },
  {
    question: "Are my files uploaded to a server?",
    answer: "<strong>Never!</strong> All compression happens 100% locally in your browser using JavaScript. Your PDF never leaves your device - complete privacy guaranteed."
