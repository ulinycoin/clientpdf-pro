      "Maximum Privacy: Your PDF never leaves your device. Cloud PDF editors upload files to servers. LocalPDF adds text locally using client-side rendering.",
      "Full Formatting Control: Customize font size, color, position, and alignment. Place text anywhere on any page with pixel precision.",
      "No Watermarks: Many free PDF editors stamp their logo on edited files. LocalPDF never adds branding or watermarks to your documents.",
      "Instant Preview: See exactly how text will appear before saving. Adjust position and formatting in real-time.",
      "Preserve Original Quality: Text is added as an overlay layer without re-encoding the PDF. Original pages remain pristine.",
      "No Page Limits: Add text to PDFs of any length. Cloud tools often restrict free users to 10-50 pages."
