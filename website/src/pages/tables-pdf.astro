const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Which file formats are supported for table creation?",
    answer: "LocalPDF supports Microsoft Excel (.xlsx, .xls) and Comma Separated Values (.csv) files. You can also manually create tables within the tool."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the tool handle very wide tables?",
    answer: "Our advanced layout engine automatically calculates column widths. For extremely wide tables, we use horizontal pagination (split-tiling) to ensure all data is readable, repeating the first column for context on every page."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the look of my PDF tables?",
    answer: "Yes! You can choose header colors, enable zebra striping for better readability, adjust font sizes, and toggle border visibility. You can also switch between Portrait and Landscape orientations."
  },
  {
    question: "Are my Excel/CSV files safe?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Like all LocalPDF tools, processing happens 100% locally in your browser. Your data files never leave your device and are never uploaded to any server."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I convert multiple Excel sheets at once?",
    answer: "Yes, when you upload an Excel workbook, you can select any combination of sheets to include. Each sheet will be rendered as a separate table section in the resulting PDF."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to install any software?",
    answer: "No. LocalPDF is a web-based application that works directly in your browser without any plugins or installations."
