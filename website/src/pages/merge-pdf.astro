const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is Smart Merge and how does it work?",
    answer: "Smart Merge is our AI-powered feature that automatically analyzes your PDF documents and suggests optimal sorting options. It detects dates within documents, recognizes filename patterns (like part1, part2), identifies potential duplicates, and offers one-click sorting — all processed locally in your browser for complete privacy."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I merge password-protected PDFs?",
    answer: "Yes, but you'll need to provide the user password for each protected PDF before merging. The merged output won't be password-protected unless you use our <a href='/protect-pdf'>Protect PDF tool</a> afterward."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit on the number of PDFs I can merge?",
    answer: "No limit during beta! You can merge as many PDF files as you want. The only constraint is your device's available memory. Most modern devices can handle merging dozens of PDFs without issues."
  },
  {
    question: "Will the merged PDF keep bookmarks and links?",
    answer: "Yes! Our merge tool preserves internal bookmarks, hyperlinks, and document metadata from all source PDFs. Bookmarks are combined in the order you arrange the files."
  },
  {
    question: "Does merging reduce PDF quality?",
    answer: "No quality loss! Merging is a <strong>lossless operation</strong> - all pages, images, fonts, and formatting are preserved exactly as they appear in the original files. No compression or downsampling occurs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change the order of PDFs before merging?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Before clicking 'Merge', you can drag and drop files to rearrange them in any order. You can also use Smart Merge to automatically sort by date, filename, or file size. Preview pages from each PDF to ensure correct ordering."
  },
  {
    question: "How does duplicate detection work?",
    answer: "Smart Merge analyzes the text content of your PDFs and compares file sizes to identify potential duplicates or very similar documents. When found, you'll see a warning with an option to keep only the first file from each duplicate group."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if PDFs have different page sizes?",
    answer: "The merged PDF will preserve the original page size for each page. For example, if you merge an A4 document with a Letter-size document, the output will contain both page sizes in the final file."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I merge PDFs without compromising data security?",
    answer: "To merge PDFs securely, use a **client-side tool** like LocalPDF. The merging process is executed **locally in your browser's RAM** using WebAssembly, ensuring your files never leave your device. This **no-upload approach** provides superior data sovereignty compared to cloud-based alternatives."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I merge PDFs on mobile devices?",
    answer: "Yes! Our tool works on iOS (Safari), Android (Chrome), and all modern mobile browsers. The interface adapts to touchscreens for easy drag-and-drop file arrangement."
