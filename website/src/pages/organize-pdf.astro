const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is Smart Organize and how does it help?",
    answer: "Smart Organize is our AI-powered feature that automatically analyzes your PDF and detects issues like blank pages, duplicate pages, incorrectly rotated pages, and chapter structure. It offers one-click actions to fix these issues instantly — all processed locally for complete privacy."
  },
  {
    question: "How does blank page detection work?",
    answer: "Smart Organize scans each page for text and images. Pages with no meaningful content (only page numbers or completely empty) are flagged as blank. Pages with images are never marked as blank, even without text. You can remove all blank pages with one click."
  },
  {
    question: "Can it detect duplicate pages?",
    answer: "Yes! Smart Organize compares page content using intelligent hashing. If you accidentally scanned a page twice or have repeated content, it will detect and highlight duplicates so you can remove them."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I reorder pages in a password-protected PDF?",
    answer: "Yes! You'll need to provide the user password first. The reorganized output won't be password-protected unless you use our <a href='/protect-pdf'>Protect PDF tool</a> afterward."
  },
  {
    question: "What page operations can I perform?",
    answer: "You can <strong>reorder pages</strong> by drag-and-drop, <strong>rotate pages</strong> in 90° increments, and <strong>delete unwanted pages</strong>. Smart Organize also offers quick actions to remove blank pages, fix rotations, and remove duplicates automatically."
  },
  {
    question: "Does organizing affect PDF quality?",
    answer: "No quality loss! Organizing is a <strong>lossless operation</strong> - all content, images, fonts, and formatting are preserved exactly. No compression occurs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Smart Organize detect chapters?",
    answer: "Yes! It recognizes chapter headings and section markers in multiple languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Russian). The detected structure is displayed so you can navigate quickly to specific sections."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I undo changes before downloading?",
    answer: "Yes! You can reorder pages multiple times, rotate them back, or restore deleted pages before downloading. Nothing is final until you click 'Download Organized PDF'."
  },
  {
    question: "Are my files uploaded to a server?",
    answer: "<strong>Never!</strong> All page organization and AI analysis happens 100% locally in your browser using JavaScript. Your PDFs never leave your device - that's our core privacy guarantee."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I organize PDFs on mobile devices?",
    answer: "Yes! Our tool works on iOS (Safari), Android (Chrome), and all modern mobile browsers. The drag-and-drop interface is optimized for touchscreens."
