const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Can I reorder pages in a password-protected PDF?",
    answer: "Yes! You'll need to provide the user password first. The reorganized output won't be password-protected unless you use our <a href='/protect-pdf'>Protect PDF tool</a> afterward."
  },
  {
    question: "What page operations can I perform?",
    answer: "You can <strong>reorder pages</strong> by drag-and-drop, <strong>rotate pages</strong> in 90° increments, and <strong>delete unwanted pages</strong>. All operations are instant and work together."
  },
  {
    question: "Does organizing affect PDF quality?",
    answer: "No quality loss! Organizing is a <strong>lossless operation</strong> - all content, images, fonts, and formatting are preserved exactly. No compression occurs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I undo changes before downloading?",
    answer: "Yes! You can reorder pages multiple times, rotate them back, or restore deleted pages before downloading. Nothing is final until you click 'Download Organized PDF'."
  },
  {
    question: "Will bookmarks and links be preserved?",
    answer: "Internal links and bookmarks are preserved. However, bookmark page references may not update automatically when pages are reordered - you might need to manually update them afterward."
  },
  {
    question: "How many pages can I organize?",
    answer: "No limit! You can organize PDFs with hundreds of pages. The only constraint is your device's available memory. Most modern devices handle large documents easily."
  },
  {
    question: "Are my files uploaded to a server?",
    answer: "<strong>Never!</strong> All page organization happens 100% locally in your browser using JavaScript. Your PDFs never leave your device - that's our core privacy guarantee."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I organize PDFs on mobile devices?",
    answer: "Yes! Our tool works on iOS (Safari), Android (Chrome), and all modern mobile browsers. The drag-and-drop interface is optimized for touchscreens."
