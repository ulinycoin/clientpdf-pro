    title: "Why Choose Our PDF Page Deleter?",
    reasons: [
      "Maximum Privacy: Your PDF never leaves your device. Cloud tools require uploading entire documents to delete a few pages. LocalPDF processes locally.",
      "Flexible Selection: Delete individual pages, ranges (e.g., 5-10), or multiple non-consecutive pages. Visual page previews help avoid mistakes.",
      "Preserve Quality: Remaining pages maintain original quality. No re-compression or degradation during the deletion process.",
      "Instant Processing: No upload delays. Page deletion happens in your browser at native speed â€” typically under 2 seconds.",
      "Undo Before Download: Review remaining pages before saving. Accidentally deleted the wrong page? Just re-upload and try again.",
      "No File Size Limits: Remove pages from PDFs of any size. Cloud tools often restrict large file uploads."
