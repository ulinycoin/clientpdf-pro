  faqs={[
    {
      question: "What is Smart Image Filter and how does it work?",
      answer: "Smart Image Filter is an AI-powered feature that automatically categorizes your images into Photos (high-quality photos), Charts (diagrams and graphs), Logos (brand marks), Icons (small UI elements), and Decorations (banners, backgrounds). It analyzes image size, dimensions, format (JPG/PNG), and file size to classify each image with confidence scores. All processing happens locally in your browser using advanced algorithms — no images are uploaded to servers."
    },
    {
      question: "How does duplicate detection work?",
      answer: "Duplicate detection uses SHA-256 cryptographic hashing to create unique fingerprints for each image. Even if you rename files or copy them to different folders, identical images will have the same hash. When duplicates are found, the tool groups them together and shows a 'Remove Duplicates' button. One click removes all but the first occurrence of each duplicate, keeping your PDF clean and reducing file size."
    },
    {
      question: "What are Quick Filter presets?",
      answer: "'Useful Images' keeps only Photos and Charts, removing icons and decorations. 'Photos Only' selects high-quality photos (usually JPG files >100KB). 'No Icons' excludes small icons and decorative elements. 'Large Images' keeps images larger than 0.1 megapixels. These presets help you quickly clean up image collections before converting to PDF."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Auto-Orientation change my image files?",
      answer: "No, Auto-Orientation only suggests the optimal page orientation (portrait or landscape) based on your image dimensions. It doesn't rotate or modify your images. The tool analyzes whether most images are wider (landscape) or taller (portrait) and sets the PDF page orientation accordingly. You can still manually change orientation after using Auto-Orientation."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do some photos get classified as Charts?",
      answer: "The classifier prioritizes JPG files with good file size (>100KB) as Photos. PNG files are more likely to be Charts because screenshots and diagrams are typically saved as PNG. If a photo is incorrectly classified, you can still include it in your PDF — the Smart Image Filter is optional and all images remain available. You can also manually select categories to show/hide images."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I disable Smart Image Filter?",
      answer: "Yes! There's a toggle switch in the Smart Image Filter panel. When disabled, the panel collapses to a compact view and no analysis runs. All your images will be included in the PDF conversion without any filtering or categorization. You can toggle it on/off at any time."
    },
    {
      question: "How many images can I convert at once?",
      answer: "You can upload up to 50 images at once. There's no file size limit per image. Since all processing happens in your browser, the actual limit depends on your device's available memory. For large batches (100+ images), consider splitting them into multiple PDFs to avoid browser memory issues."
    },
    {
      question: "What image formats are supported?",
      answer: "JPG/JPEG and PNG formats are supported. These cover 99% of digital photos and graphics. Other formats like GIF, WebP, or HEIC need to be converted to JPG/PNG first (you can use online converters or your OS's built-in image tools)."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my privacy protected when using AI features?",
      answer: "Absolutely! All AI processing (image categorization, duplicate detection, orientation analysis) runs entirely in your browser. No images are uploaded to servers. No data leaves your device. Unlike cloud-based converters that send images to servers for 'AI analysis', LocalPDF's Smart Image Filter works 100% offline after the initial page load."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I see all pages of the PDF before downloading?",
      answer: "Yes! After conversion, you'll see a multi-page preview showing all pages in a grid layout. The first 10 pages display automatically, with a 'Show All' button to load remaining pages if needed. This lets you verify the final PDF before downloading."
