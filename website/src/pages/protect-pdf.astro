  {
    question: "What encryption standard is used?",
    answer: "We use laboratory-grade **AES-256 bit encryption**, which is the current standard for high-security applications worldwide. Your document is encrypted directly in your browser using the browser's native cryptographic APIs."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between User and Owner passwords?",
    answer: "The **User Password** (Open Password) is required to view the document. The **Owner Password** (Permissions Password) is required to change security settings or override usage restrictions like printing or copying text."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I recover a forgotten password?",
    answer: "No. Since LocalPDF processing is entirely local and we do not store your passwords or documents, there is no way for us to recover a forgotten password. Please ensure you keep your passwords secure."
  },
  {
    question: "Are my passwords sent to a server?",
    answer: "No. Your passwords never leave your browser. They are used locally to generate the encryption keys needed to secure your PDF file in your device's memory."
