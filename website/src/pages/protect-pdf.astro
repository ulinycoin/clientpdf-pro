      "AES-256 Encryption: Uses the same encryption standard as military and banking applications. Your protected PDF is secure against brute-force attacks.",
      "No Password Storage: We never see or store your password. Only you know the encryption key, ensuring complete confidentiality.",
      "Works Offline: Once loaded, protect PDFs without internet. Perfect for confidential documents that shouldn't be transmitted over networks.",
      "Instant Encryption: No upload time, no processing queues. Encryption happens in your browser at native speed â€” usually under 2 seconds."
