    title: "Why Choose Our PDF Watermark Tool?",
    reasons: [
      "Complete Privacy: Your PDF never leaves your device. Cloud watermark tools upload documents to servers. LocalPDF applies watermarks locally using client-side rendering.",
      "Customizable Appearance: Control watermark text, position, opacity, rotation, and size. Create subtle background marks or prominent overlays.",
      "No Watermark on Watermarks: Ironic but true — some free tools add their own branding when you watermark PDFs. LocalPDF never adds our logo or URL to your files.",
      "Instant Processing: No upload delays. Watermarks render in your browser at native speed, typically under 3 seconds even for multi-page documents.",
      "Preserve Original Quality: Watermarks are added as overlay layers without re-encoding the entire PDF. Original page quality and structure remain intact.",
      "Batch Watermarking: Apply the same watermark to multiple PDFs sequentially without re-uploading or reconfiguring settings."
