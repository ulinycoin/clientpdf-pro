# Reddit Post: Prerendering Cost Optimization Journey

## Target Subreddit
**r/SideProject** - Flair: "Launched"

## Title
Cut my SEO costs from $1,080/year to $0.24/year with self-hosted prerendering

---

## Post

I run LocalPDF, a browser-based PDF toolkit. As a React SPA, it's invisible to search bots - they only see an empty HTML shell.

### The Journey

**Month 1: Tried Prerender.io**
- ‚úÖ Works great
- ‚ùå $90/month for decent limits
- ‚ùå Cache expires every 3 days
- **Verdict**: Not sustainable for side project

**Month 2: Migrated to free Render.com + Rendertron**
- ‚úÖ Free hosting
- ‚ùå Cold starts (15min sleep ‚Üí 10-30s first request)
- ‚ùå Slow responses (5-15s)
- **Verdict**: Better, but not great

**Month 3: Built GCS caching layer on Google Cloud Run**
- ‚úÖ 168-686ms responses (Vercel Edge cache)
- ‚úÖ 175-1250ms on GCS cache hit
- ‚úÖ 96% cache coverage (79/82 pages)
- ‚úÖ $0.02/month costs
- **Verdict**: Perfect! üéâ

### The Architecture (Simple Version)

```
User ‚Üí Vercel Middleware ‚Üí Cloud Run Rendertron
                             ‚îú‚îÄ Cache Proxy (checks GCS first)
                             ‚îî‚îÄ Rendertron (renders if needed)
```

**3-tier caching:**
1. Vercel Edge (1 hour) - super fast
2. GCS bucket (24 hours) - still very fast
3. Rendertron render (on demand) - slower but rare

**Automated warming:**
- GitHub Actions runs every 6 hours
- Keeps critical pages warm
- Prevents cold starts for search bots

### The Numbers

| Metric | Before (Prerender.io) | After (Cloud Run + GCS) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Cost/month** | $90 | $0.02 |
| **Cost/year** | $1,080 | $0.24 |
| **Savings** | - | **99.98%** |
| **Response time** | 28ms (hit), 3-4s (miss) | 168-686ms (Edge), 175-1250ms (GCS) |
| **Cache coverage** | Limited by 3-day TTL | 96% (79/82 pages) |
| **Languages** | All 5 (EN/RU/DE/FR/ES) | All 5 |

### Why This Matters for Side Projects

Most SPA developers face this choice:
- Pay $90-200/month for Prerender.io or similar
- Accept poor SEO and lose organic traffic
- Spend weeks building custom solution

I found a middle path: **self-hosted prerendering with aggressive caching**.

### Impact on Traffic

Expected results (based on industry benchmarks):
- +25-40% organic traffic across all languages
- Better Google indexing (was 0%, now 100%)
- Improved Core Web Vitals for bots
- Full multilingual SEO (5 languages)

### Lessons for Side Projects

1. **SaaS costs add up fast** - $90/month killed my margins
2. **Self-hosting isn't scary** - Cloud Run is easier than you think
3. **Cache everything** - 3 layers of caching = consistent performance
4. **Automate monitoring** - Daily health checks via simple script
5. **Free tier limits are real** - Render.com sleeps after 15min, Cloud Run doesn't

### Tech Stack (High Level)
- **Rendering**: Rendertron (open-source headless Chrome)
- **Caching**: Google Cloud Storage (24-hour TTL)
- **Edge**: Vercel (1-hour cache)
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (warming every 6 hours)
- **Monitoring**: Custom bash script + Cloud Run logs

### The Result

LocalPDF now gets full SEO coverage for:
- 23 English pages
- 22 Russian pages
- 11 German pages
- 12 French pages
- 11 Spanish pages

All for **$0.24/year** instead of **$1,080/year**.
